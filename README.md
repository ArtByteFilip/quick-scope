# Quick Scope

A small utility for gamers that captures and magnifies the center portion of the screen, providing a zoomed-in view — perfect for enhancing visibility when aiming through a sniper scope in first-person shooter (FPS) games.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Automatically starts recording a **300x300px area** at the center of the screen.
- Displays a **scaled-up 1000x1000px view** of that area.
- Helps improve aiming precision when using a sniper scope or long-range weapon in games that do not provide zoom assist or when additional visibility is needed.

## 🎯 Use Case

Imagine you're playing a game that doesn't offer a clear or zoomed sniper scope. This tool creates a real-time zoom overlay of your crosshair area, allowing for better visibility and more accurate shots — all without modifying the game or breaking any rules.

## ⚙️ Features

- Lightweight and minimal design
- Automatically detects screen center
- Smooth and responsive zoom view
- No game injection — works independently
- Toggle on/off easily (optional hotkey setup)
